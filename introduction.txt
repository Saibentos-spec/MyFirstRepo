Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Saiba Moise. I am passionate about technology, especially backend development and IT support. I'm actively learning Python and GitHub to enhance my software engineering skills.

Outside of tech, I run community support projects and enjoy mentoring others. This file is part of my journey through a GitHub learning exercise.
